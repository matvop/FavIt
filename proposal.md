# PyLapse

## High-Level Product:
The PyLapse web-app will provide user with a web interface to access, add,
remove, monitor public or private network/IP camera(s). Will include the
ability to take snapshots at a specified interval for a specified duration
and then combine the images into a time-lapse video file upon completion.

          * Enter user-name(grayed out unless private)
          * Enter password(grayed out unless private)
          * Option to enable snapshots for time-lapse
          * Enter snapshot interval
          * Option to cancel/go back
      * Edit Project/Camera
        * Pop-up window
          * Configuration
            * View/edit whether camera stream is public or private
            * View/edit camera url(IP/Hostname with Port)
            * View/edit user-name(grayed out unless private)
            * View/edit password(grayed out unless private)
            * View/edit option to enable/disable snapshots
            * View/edit snapshot interval
          * Remove camera
          * Cancel/go back
    * View Images:
      * List of project directories sorted by project name
        * List of snapshot directories sorted by record date('%m.%d.%Y')
          * Thumbnails/tiles of snapshot images sorted by time('%H.%M.%S')
            * Thumbnails to open into a 'pop-up' and/or gallery viewing solution using CSS/HTML/JavaScript/JQuery
    * Exit/Go back

## Data Model:
Configuration database:
```
[
    {
        project_name:
            [public_or_private, url, user, pass,
             snapshot_enable, snap_interval, session_number]
    }
]
```
Project snapshot and video database:
```
{
    session_number:
        [[snapshot_1, snapshot_2, snapshot_3], video]
}
```


## Technical Components:
+ Database(s)
  * Required to store configuration data like camera url(s) and login info along with images and video generated by the snapshot/time lapse features
+ Django
  * Use to communicate input from the user into the database
+ Python
  * Save snapshots on a specified interval
  * Create time lapse video from snapshots
  * Generate search-able string to store with media in database(date/time)
+ JavaScript
  * To display dynamic content (images and camera streams) using JQuery
  * To enlarge low resolution stream(s)
+ HTML/CSS and/or JavaScript
  * Configuration settings for camera's network info(i.e. IP, user name, password, ports).
  * Interface to monitor video streams and edit configuration settings, as well as search for recordings.

## Timeline:
1. Writing the Python module to record snapshots and generate time lapse video files.
1. Build a database solution to store images, videos and configuration settings.
1. Develop a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display projects and snapshots.
